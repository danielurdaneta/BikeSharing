# Bike Sharing

## Overview of the project

The purpose of this project was to analyze Citi Bike data in New York City in order to study the feasibility of creating this same service in other cities and show it to investors. We did this by creating different visualizations using Pandas and Tableau.

## Results 

Below are the graphs made after a thorough analysis of the data, you can find them all in Tableu in the following link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/daniel3907/viz/Challenge_16271436535880/CitiBikeNYC?publish=yes

 The graph show that people use less the bike service between 2 and 5am and more between 4 and 6 with a peak of 224.566 users.

The heatmap shows that males tend to be subscribed to the service and "unknown" gender tend to be more a casual customer, in the other hand the pie chart shows that males compound most of the users being 65% of the total.

These line charts shows that most of the rides tend to last between 1 to 10 minutes for all genders.

In this heatmap we can see a considerably higher amount of males using the service during late hours than other genders.

## Summary

- As we can see, males are the ones that use the service the most, which is something to take on account while looking to where to place the bike station or to do promotion.
- On weekdays people usually use the bikes to commute with a peak hour between 5 and 6pm.
- Most of the rides last between 0 to 10 minutes and males tend to be subscribed which is something to take on account while setting the cost of the service.
- We can make two more graphs, one to see where people tend to take the bike and another one to see where they tend to drop it, this information can be useful to find patterns in these behaviors and the location.
